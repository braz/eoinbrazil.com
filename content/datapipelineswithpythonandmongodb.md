Both of my talks source's and examples are in Github repos, [PyCon 2015](https://github.com/braz/pycon2015_talk) and [MongoDB Days UK 2015](https://github.com/braz/mongodbdays2015_talk). The PyCon talk was aimed at introducing how you can use Python for building a data pipeline where MongoDB was the source for your data.

The [MongoDB Days UK talk](https://speakerdeck.com/braz/pycon-2015-using-mongodb-and-python-for-data-analysis-p) but was aimed at more advanced MongoDB audience.
