My home office is literally a desk in the corner of a bedroom which is returned to use as a bedroom after I finish work. All the setup and gear I have fits this requirement. 

#### Furniture

A fold away desk isn't a typical order but in Dublin there were two companies, [Ministry of Makers](https://ministryofmakers.ie/) and [Flying Elephant](https://www.flyingelephant.ie/) who supply desks that fit the criteria. I went the Halfway desk from Ministry of Makers and even coated it a few times with Danish Oil for good measure. I couldn't find a fold away chair that I liked nor could I justify buying an Aeron, in the end I went for a [Koplus TONIQUE Ergonomic mesh chair](https://www.koplus.eu/en/products/tonique).

#### Laptop, mouse and webcam

My computer is a MacBook and I use it with a [Griffin Elavator stand](https://griffintechnology.com/products/elevator) as well as a [Logitech wireless m570 trackball mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-roeu/product/wireless-trackball-m570). I use an [EditorsKey Vi cover](https://www.editorskeys.com/products/vi-vim-keyboard-covers-for-macbook-imac) on it which probably has saved it from disaster to often to count. I use a [Logitech C920 web cam](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/hd-pro-webcam-c920) instead of the Macbook standard webcam, it's definitely an improvement.

#### Networking gear

I upgraded my home network during May to a [Unifi Dream Machine](https://eu.store.ui.com/products/unifi-dream-machine) and [FlexHD](https://eu.store.ui.com/collections/unifi/products/unifi-flexhd) primarily inspired by [this post from Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/friends-dont-let-friends-use-dodgy-wifi-introducing-ubiquitis-dream-machine-and-flexhd/). It has been brilliant and I can't recommend it highly enough.

#### Audio gear

I use two different audio recording configurations, the normal day to day uses a [Rode Podcaster USB Broadcast Microphone](http://www.rode.com/microphones/podcaster), a [PSA1 Studio Boom Arm](http://www.rode.com/accessories/psa1) and [SMR Advanced Shock Mount](http://www.rode.com/accessories/smr) for my normal calls (typically Zoom). I use a second setup for recording voice overs which uses a [Countryman E6 Omni XLR](https://countryman.com/product/e6-earset/) (over ear mic) and a [Senal XLR-USB XU-1648](https://www.senalsound.com/product/7950/Senal-XU_1648-XLR_to_USB-Interface). These are fed through some audio software I'll cover separately.

I use a set of closed [Audio-Technica ATH-M40X](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/ath-m40x) for my headphones.

#### Lighting gear

My lighting is from a [Elgato Key Light Air](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/key-light-air) and a [LumeCube Video Conference Lighting for Remote Working](https://lumecube.com/products/video-conference-lighting-kit-for-remote-workers). I only recently got the Elgato and it's replaced LumeCube as my main light. I plan on using the much smaller LubeCube as a secondary light or when traveling.

#### Additional gear for various tasks

I use a [HooToo USB C Hub](https://www.hootoo.com/p/b07yb2znrn) to manage all the peripherals. I have a few extras pieces that I use for teaching including a [Luna Display](https://shop.astropad.com/) (allows me to use an iPad as a second screen and indeed input to my laptop), a pair of [Joby Gorillapod tripods](https://joby.com/global/gorillapod-flexible-camera-tripods/), and a MEKO Upgraded Fine Tip Stylus Pen for an iPad. I also have a [Joby GripTight Pro 2](https://joby.com/global/griptight-pro-2-mount-jb01525-bww/) which I use to hold my phone as an ad-hoc whiteboard with the [Camo app](https://reincubate.com/camo/). I have also been experimenting with [OBS Open Broadcast Software](https://obsproject.com/).

I also have a pack of [Video Conference Cards](https://agilestationery.co.uk/products/video-conference-cards) from Agile Stationery which are great fun to use.

#### Software

I use [Vanilla](https://matthewpalmer.net/vanilla/) to manage the menu bar, [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704) to keep my laptop on, [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) for various macros, [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) for a nice toolbar, and [Witch](https://manytricks.com/witch/) for window screen switching. I use [SnapNDrag Pro](https://www.yellowmug.com/snapndrag/) for screen or window captures. I use [ScreenFlow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm) for capturing the voice overs of lessons and indeed any video offline capture.

In terms of my audio software, I went all in on [Rogue Amoeba](https://rogueamoeba.com/) and love all of their software. I use [SoundSource](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/) for managing my sources, [Audio Hijack](https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/) for various tasks including some preprocessing on my mic input, [Loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) for wiring my Audio Hijack output to my Zoom or desired application, and [Farrango](https://rogueamoeba.com/farrago/) for adding the odd random sound effect.
