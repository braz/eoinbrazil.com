I was at PyCon Ireland 2018 this year and lukcy to have my talk on Observability accepted.

The title of the talk was ["Adding the three pillars of Observability to your Python app"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k3ORfyxYjV56N4j4f_n5B--kWHWE8qQ93WiuGo2Kjos/edit?usp=sharing) and was aimed at an intermediate Python audience defining observability, monitoring as well as highlighting various tools/libraries I found useful in my work in this area. I spoke about many of my own learnings building observability into exsting Python applications and services.
