I'd been holding off on this post for the last few months as I'd being asked by Shannon Bradshaw to help write the third edition of "MongoDB: The Definitive Guide". I wanted to wait until it was well underway and by the time I'd gotten back to this post, it ended up being past the first copy writing check of the entire book.

The O'Reilly page is at ["MongoDB: The Definitive Guide, 3rd Edition - Powerful and Scalable Data Storage"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049531.do) and still has to catch up with a few things including my addition as co-author! It's all coming along smoothly for a December release.
