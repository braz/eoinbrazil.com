I'm a technology guy with a background in UX, computer science and technology commercialisation. I've been with MongoDB for the last six years starting in the Technical Services moving from an engineering role to a team lead role before moving to the Education department's Curriculum team producing and delivering training and content for the MongoDB University. Prior to MongoDB that I spent several years working bringing research to commercialisation and managing consultancy projects with companies in Ireland and the USA. Here's my [CV]({static}/extras/vitae-eoinbrazil-feb-2019-dev.pdf) if you want a little more depth about me.

I love science, technology, craft beer, whisky and statistics.
