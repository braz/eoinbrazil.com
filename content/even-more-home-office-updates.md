This post follows two earlier posts ([here](http://eoinbrazil.com/home-office-bill-of-materials.html) and [here](http://eoinbrazil.com/home-office-updates.html)), which describe my furniture and equipment. This post focuses on three very optional pieces of equipment that I have added, an 8-way surge protector, a headphone amplifier, and an upgrade to my USB hub. I also figured I would mention an old workhorse that has been plugging away for years at home, my old reliable 4-bay NAS.

#### Surge protector

I think a reliable surge protecctor is something everyone should invest in once you have a decent amount of equipment. It is essentially one of those things you buy and hope you never have to use it, like insurance.

I bought two [APC Surge Arrest Essential 8 socket](https://www.apc.com/shop/ie/en/products/APC-Essential-SurgeArrest-8-outlets-230V-UK/P-PM8-UK) protectors. This is a high-end model as it provides a good surge energy rating of 2754 Joules. The surge energy rating is how much energy the protector can absorb before it fails. A rating of 2000 and above is general on the high end of the ratings and aimed at computers with valuable data you want to protect or high value electronics. I use one unit for my home office and I bought a second unit to protect my router, my Unifi Dream Machine, and my home NAS. In the midst of day 2 of a 6 week lockdown, suddenly thinking about business continuity doesn't seem like that bad a plan!

#### Headphone amplifier

I had not really gotten in the audiophile area before and this is my first headphone amplifier. Honestly, I was hesistant to get something but it turns out that there was a new entrant, [iFi Zen DAC](https://ifi-audio.com/products/zen-dac/) that was worth considering. I read [this review from What Hifi?](https://www.whathifi.com/reviews/ifi-zen-dac) that really changed my mind. I took the advice in that review and also got a [iFi iPower X power supply](https://ifi-audio.com/products/ipower/).

Honestly, this has greatly improved my listening experience. I haven't yet upgraded to the likes of Spotify Premium (I'm thinking about it alright!) but even with the freemium version there is a clear improvement with my existing headphones.

#### Thunderbolt 3 Mac Dock

As I've added more and more accessories to my home office I was running out of USB ports on my old USB hub which had 3 ports. I decided to upgrade the capacity and went for the [Caldigit TS3 Plus](https://www.caldigit.com/ts3-plus/) which provides a 5 USB-A ports and 2 USB-C ports as well as a host of others including an SD Card Reader.

It also is powered and has sufficient power to both drive my accessories as well as charging my laptop.

I don't have a monitor but if I do decide to get one this unit will easily handle it.

#### Home NAS

I have had a Home NAS for storing various documents, videos, photos and songs. It is a [Western Digital EX4100 4-bay NAS](https://shop.westerndigital.com/products/network-attached-storage/wd-my-cloud-expert-series-ex4100). It works well and almost invisibly in the background.
