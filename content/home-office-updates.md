Last month I wrote [a short piece on my home office setup](http://eoinbrazil.com/home-office-bill-of-materials.html). I wanted to follow up on that as I've added a few additional pieces of equipment, particularly I've improved my web camera significantly.

#### Webcam, camera, and stand for mounting

I had previously used a [Logitech C920 web cam](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/hd-pro-webcam-c920) instead of the Macbook standard webcam and the big change to my setup was adding a [Fujifilm X-T200](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/x-t200/). The camera is a mirrorless body and I managed to pick up a deal which included a [FUJINON XC15-45mm F3.5-5.6 OIS PZ lense](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/lenses/xc15-45mmf35-56-ois-pz/). The deal and the fact that Fujifilm is one of several camera manufacturers who enabled their cameras to be used as USB web cams with a firmware update.

In order to complete the setup I got a microphone stand, a [Rode DS1 Microphone Desk Stand](http://www.rode.com/accessories/ds1) with a [CAMVATE 1/4" Male to 5/8" Female Microphone Stand Adapter](https://www.camvate.com/camvate-thread-adapter-microphone-stand-5-8quot-27-female-to-1-4quot-20-male-for-camera-monitor_p1361.html) to convert the microphone thread to a standard camera thread. The final part to mount the camera was a [JOBY BallHead 3K](https://joby.com/global/ballhead-3k-jb01513-bww/), I love Joby's kit and whilst slightly more expense than other mounting options I'm happy to pay a premium for solid, reliable kit.

#### Charging, Extra Batteries, Lens Hood and Lense filter

The camera does charge via USB but it's quite slow to charge (~6 hours). I found a great little charger that both quick and takes two batteries, [Nitecore FX1 Fujifilm W126/W126s 2 Hour Dual Slot](https://www.nitecorestore.com/NITECORE-FX1-Charger-for-Fujifilm-Camera-Battery-p/chg-nite-fx1.htm).

There isn't a way to easily power the camera from mains power whilst it is in use so I also picked up to two additional batteries, a [HL-F126S TWIN PACK](https://www.hahnel.ie/irish-shop/productUrl/f126twin/). I can easily juggle to my old webcam and swap the battery for meetings so I'm not too worried about this so far.

In order to protect the lense, I got a [Hoya Pro-1 Digital Protector](https://hoyafilter.com/product/pro1d_protector/) and [a JJC Lens Hood](http://www.jjc.cc/index.php/Product/product_info/id/2172). I hope these aren't needed to protect the lense but if they are I'd much prefer for both of these to take the damage rather than the lense.

#### Chair mounted Green Screen

I finally managed to find a green screen that would work with the limited space I had. The [Gig Gear Cam-A-Lot Video Conferencing Background Privacy Screen (Green/White)](https://www.gig-gear.com/products/cam-a-lot) which simply folds out and sits on the back of your chair.

#### A pair of blue light glasses

I have to admit using and abandoning a prior set of blue light glasses as they weren't a good fit. Second time round, I'd seen a few folks talk about Ambr Eyewear for blue light glasses (here's looking at [Alan](https://twitter.com/AlanMeaney), [Pat](https://twitter.com/patphelan), and [Jess Kelly](https://twitter.com/jesskellynt)) so I went and got a pair of [Zenith glasses from them](https://ambreyewear.com/collections/our-range/products/zenith). A week on and I have to admit they do appear to be helping and most importantly they fit well so I'm much more likely to be wearing them for the long term.
