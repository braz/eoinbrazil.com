The book is now available as eBook with the paperback version due by the end of the Month. You can also read it directly on [O'Reilly's Learning Platform](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049531.do#).

It is fantastic to see the book and my name on sites like [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/MongoDB-Definitive-Powerful-Scalable-Storage-ebook-dp-B082J7DMBX/dp/B082J7DMBX) and [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/mongodb-shannon-bradshaw/1125068161).
