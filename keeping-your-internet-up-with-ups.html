            <p>In the age of working from home, work has mostly moved to the laptop for many. This means that the odd blip in terms of power normally on their machine. This isn&#8217;t the case for your home network infrastructure, specifically your router and/or modem. A uninterruptible power supply (<span class="caps">UPS</span>) is essentially a big battery that is used to keep your hardware up when the power is out. Laptops essentially already have a big battery so in many cases a <span class="caps">UPS</span> is not necessary where the power cuts last for minutes or a couple of hours at most. The recent uncertainty around the winter power supply in the Dublin region prompted me to look more into this&nbsp;area.</p>
<h2>My backup power&nbsp;recipe</h2>
<p>Mostly routers and modems are pretty low power, they run anywhere from a dozen watts to maybe twice that for the really fully featured models. This means that you can get a moderately powered <span class="caps">UPS</span> which will be able to offer power for an hour or more to these devices. I went with <span class="caps">APC</span> and specifically with the <a href="https://www.apc.com/shop/products/Back-UPS-Pro-BR-650VA-6-Outlets-AVR-LCD-Interface/P-BR650MI"><span class="caps">BR650MI</span> Back <span class="caps">UPS</span> Pro <span class="caps">BR</span> <span class="caps">650VA</span></a>.</p>
<h3>Dublin&#8217;s Winter 2022 Power&nbsp;Worries</h3>
<p>The real worry I had after hearing about the potential problems in Dublin&#8217;s power supply this winter (2022) was with brown outs and potentially surges. <span class="caps">COVID</span>-19 has limited the maintenace on a number of generators in the national grid and they&#8217;re currently undergoing maintence there is an open question as to whether these will be fully functional for this winter, hence the power supply&nbsp;worries.</p>
<p>A power outage typically doesn&#8217;t impact your Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as they&#8217;ll normally have their equipment protected with <span class="caps">UPS</span> and surge&nbsp;protectors.</p>
<h3>Brown outs and&nbsp;surges</h3>
<p>Surges and brown outs are the two main reasons I went with slightly higher specification model from <span class="caps">APC</span>. Understanding what a surge and a brown out will be helpful to why I chose that&nbsp;specification.</p>
<p>A brown out is the term for when there is a drop in voltage in the power system. This can be intentional (by the power company) or unintentional (or due to a failure). It&#8217;s the intentional brown out scenario with the limited power in Dublin that was the prime reason I got a <span class="caps">UPS</span>. I hope this does not happen but if it does, I wanted to be prepared. A brown out can be imposed by the power company in an effort to reduce load and prevent a full power&nbsp;outage.</p>
<p>A surge is an abnormally high voltage lasting for a short period of time (millisecond typically), this most often is from lightning strikes. Many <span class="caps">UPS</span> offer features to protect against these shocks which can significantly damage sensitive electrical equipment like your router or modem. I&#8217;ve already got two <a href="https://www.apc.com/shop/ie/en/products/APC-Essential-SurgeArrest-8-outlets-230V-UK/P-PM8-UK"><span class="caps">APC</span> Surge Arrest Essential 8 socket</a> protectors which I discuss in <a href="">more depth in this post</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="caps">BR650MI</span> Back <span class="caps">UPS</span> Pro <span class="caps">BR</span> <span class="caps">650VA</span>&nbsp;highlights</h3>
<p>There are a couple of features in this model that helped my choice. You can checkout the <a href="https://www.apc.com/shop/products/Back-UPS-Pro-BR-650VA-6-Outlets-AVR-LCD-Interface/P-BR650MI">full specification on this page</a>.</p>
<p>It&nbsp;offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regulation of voltage, it steps up low voltage (brown out) and steps down high voltage (surge) before sending the power to your&nbsp;devices</li>
<li>Can start cold, so if the power goes completely there isn&#8217;t a lag in it providing power to the connected&nbsp;devices</li>
<li>390 Watts / 650 <span class="caps">VA</span> reasonable sized battery to give around an hour or so of supply to the devices I intend to&nbsp;connect</li>
</ul>
<h3>Setup and&nbsp;installation</h3>
