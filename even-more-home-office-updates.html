This post focuses on three very optional pieces of equipment that I have added, an 8-way surge protector, a headphone amplifier, and an upgrade to my <span class=caps>USB</span> hub. I also figured I would mention an old workhorse that has been plugging away for years at home, my old reliable 4-bay <span class=caps>NAS</span>.<h4>Surge protector</h4><p>I think a reliable surge protecctor is something everyone should invest in once you have a decent amount of equipment. It is essentially one of those things you buy and hope you never have to use it, like insurance.<p>I bought two <a href=https://www.apc.com/shop/ie/en/products/APC-Essential-SurgeArrest-8-outlets-230V-UK/P-PM8-UK><span class=caps>APC</span> Surge Arrest Essential 8 socket</a> protectors. This is a high-end model as it provides a good surge energy rating of 2754 Joules. The surge energy rating is how much energy the protector can absorb before it fails. A rating of 2000 and above is general on the high end of the ratings and aimed at computers with valuable data you want to protect or high value electronics. I use one unit for my home office and I bought a second unit to protect my router, my Unifi Dream Machine, and my home <span class=caps>NAS</span>. In the midst of day 2 of a 6 week lockdown, suddenly thinking about business continuity doesn’t seem like that bad a plan!<p><img alt="APC Surge Arrest Essential 8 socket" src=http://eoinbrazil.com/extras/apc_surge_protector_8way.png><h4>Headphone amplifier</h4><p>I had not really gotten in the audiophile area before and this is my first headphone amplifier. Honestly, I was hesistant to get something but it turns out that there was a new entrant, <a href=https://ifi-audio.com/products/zen-dac/>iFi Zen <span class=caps>DAC</span></a> that was worth considering. I read <a href=https://www.whathifi.com/reviews/ifi-zen-dac>this review from What Hifi?</a> that really changed my mind. I took the advice in that review and also got a <a href=https://ifi-audio.com/products/ipower/>iFi iPower X power supply</a>.<p>Honestly, this has greatly improved my listening experience. I haven’t yet upgraded to the likes of Spotify Premium (I’m thinking about it alright!) but even with the freemium version there is a clear improvement with my existing headphones.<p><img alt="iFi Zen DAC" src=http://eoinbrazil.com/extras/ifi_zen_dac.png><h4>Thunderbolt 3 Mac Dock</h4><p>As I’ve added more and more accessories to my home office I was running out of <span class=caps>USB</span> ports on my old <span class=caps>USB</span> hub which had 3 ports. I decided to upgrade the capacity and went for the <a href=https://www.caldigit.com/ts3-plus/>Caldigit <span class=caps>TS3</span> Plus</a> which provides a 5 <span class=caps>USB</span>-A ports and 2 <span class=caps>USB</span>-C ports as well as a host of others including an <span class=caps>SD</span> Card Reader.<p>It also is powered and has sufficient power to both drive my accessories as well as charging my laptop.<p>I don’t have a monitor but if I do decide to get one this unit will easily handle it.<h4>Home <span class=caps>NAS</span></h4><p>I have had a Home <span class=caps>NAS</span> for storing various documents, videos, photos and songs. It is a <a href=https://shop.westerndigital.com/products/network-attached-storage/wd-my-cloud-expert-series-ex4100>Western Digital <span class=caps>EX4100</span> 4-bay <span class=caps>NAS</span></a>. It works well and almost invisibly in the background.</div></div></div><div class=container><div class=span3>Related Posts</div><div class=span6><ul><li><a href=http://eoinbrazil.com/keeping-your-internet-up-with-ups.html>Keeping your home internet up with an uninterruptible power supply</a><li><a href=http://eoinbrazil.com/home-office-updates.html>Some updates to my home office</a><li><a href=http://eoinbrazil.com/home-office-bill-of-materials.html>My home office and it’s bill of materials</a><li><a href=http://eoinbrazil.com/krisp-audiohijacked-loopbacked-zoom-calls.html>Krisp Audio Hijacked Loopbacked Zoom Calls</a></ul></div></div></div><div class=container><div class=span3></div><div class=span6>Previous [ <a href=http://eoinbrazil.com/home-office-updates.html> Some updates to my home office </a> ] <br> Next [ <a href=http://eoinbrazil.com/krisp-audiohijacked-loopbacked-zoom-calls.html> Krisp Audio Hijacked Loopbacked Zoom Calls </a> ]</div></div><div class=container><div class=span3> </div><div class=span6 id=post-share-links>Share via: <a title="Share on Twitter" href=https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Even%20more%20updates%20to%20my%20home%C2%A0office&url=http%3A//eoinbrazil.com/even-more-home-office-updates.html&via=eoinbrazil&hashtags=office,equipment,hardware target=_blank><span class=symbol></span></a><a title="Share on Facebook" href=https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A//eoinbrazil.com/even-more-home-office-updates.html target=_blank><span class=symbol></span></a><a title="Share on LinkedIn" href=https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A//eoinbrazil.com/even-more-home-office-updates.html&title=Even%20more%20updates%20to%20my%20home%C2%A0office&summary=This%20post%20follows%20two%20earlier%20posts%20%28here%20and%20here%29%2C%20which%20describe%20my%20furniture%20and%20equipment.%20This%20post%20focuses%20on%20three%20very%20optional%20pieces%20of%20equipment%20that%20I%20have%20added%2C%20an%208-way%20surge%20protector%2C%20a%20headphone%20amplifier%2C%20and%20an%20upgrade%20to%20my%20USB%20hub.%20I%20also%20figured%20I%20would%20mention%20an%20%E2%80%A6&source=http%3A//eoinbrazil.com/even-more-home-office-updates.html target=_blank><span class=symbol></span></a><a title="Share on Google Plus" href target=_blank><span class=symbol></span></a><a title="Share via Email" href=mailto:?subject=Even%20more%20updates%20to%20my%20home%C2%A0office&body=http%3A//eoinbrazil.com/even-more-home-office-updates.html target=_blank><span class=symbol></span></a> Feed Subscription via: <a title="RSS Feed" href=http://eoinbrazil.com/feeds/all.rss.xml target=_blank><span class=symbol></span></a><a title="ATOM Feed" href=http://eoinbrazil.com/feeds/all.atom.xml target=_blank><span class=symbol></span></a></div></div><div class=container><div class="row comments"><div class=span3> </div><div class=span6></div></div></div><div class=footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class=span6><p><strong>Eoin Brazil</strong> is a computer scientist, UX architect, technical services engineer (similar to SRE), author, teacher and data scientist.
